<h1>Hi and welcome!</h1>
<h2>I'm [[Lanky]]. This blog is meant as a place for me to think out loud, ponder with friends, and build an archive of personal knowledge.</h2>
<p>If you're curious about the conceptual underpinnings of this blog, check out my note about the phenomenon of [[Digital Gardens]]. The basic gist is:</p>
<ul>
<li>notes are not organized chronologically</li>
<li>many of the notes you find may be incomplete</li>
<li>you can use links within the notes to navigate to other notes</li>
</ul>
